# ds3002-project2

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to create and publish an interactive Discord bot in a test server. The bot provides users with quotes using the quotable API and can perform three functions: retrieve a random quote, retrieve a quote by a specified author, and retrieve 5 random quotes containing a keyword. We created a Docker build which was then deployed in Lightsail so it could be run on any machine.
